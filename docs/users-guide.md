# Swarm Mode (Docker 1.12+)

*Docker Flow: Proxy* running in the *Swarm Mode* is designed to leverage the features introduced in *Docker v1.12+*. If you are looking for a proxy solution that would work with older Docker versions or without Swarm Mode, please explore the [Docker Flow: Proxy - Standard Mode](standard-mode.md) article.

When running in *Swarm Mode*, the *proxy* can be reconfigured automatically with the help of [Docker Flow: Swarm Listener](https://github.com/vfarcic/docker-flow-swarm-listener) or manually by sending HTTP requests.
